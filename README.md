## Features

- **Face Shape Analysis:** The system identifies your face shape (e.g., oval, round, square) to recommend suitable jewelry designs.
- **Undertone Classification:** It classifies your skin tone into warm or cool undertones to help recommend the right metal color and gemstone.
- **Color Analysis:** The system performs a color analysis to determine your dominant colors, enhancing the recommendation process.
- **Personalized Jewelry Recommendations:** Based on the analysis, it suggests jewelry styles, including earrings, necklaces, and bracelets.
- **Gemstone and Metal Color Recommendations:** It provides suggestions on gemstones and metals that complement your skin tone and facial features.

2. **Personal Features**: The system determines your face shape and undertone classification.
3. **Jewelry Design Recommendations**: Based on your face shape and skin tone, it suggests jewelry designs (e.g., earrings, necklaces).
4. **Gemstone Recommendations**: It recommends the best gemstones (e.g., Citrine, Garnet) and gemstone shapes (e.g., oval) based on your skin tone.
5. **Metal Color Recommendations**: It suggests metal colors (e.g., yellow gold or rose gold) that complement your skin tone.
